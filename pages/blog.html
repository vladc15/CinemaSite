            <h3> The Social Network - A Review </h3>
            <p>“The Social Network” presents the rise of the multi-billion company Facebook through its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who grows from a Harvard student to one of the most influencial people nowadays.
            </p>

            <h3> The plot </h3>
            <p> The story begins on an evening in 2003, when Mark, a computer science student, creates a campus website designed for socialising. Later, together with his close friend, Eduardo Saverin, lay the groundwork for a social networking website extended to all Ivy League colleges, named Facebook. As the project grows in popularity, they have a meeting with Napster founder, Sean Parker, for a possible collaboration. Even though he just met Sean, Zuckerberg is quickly impressed by his suggestions, letting him make several important changes to the firm. Discovering a new investment deal, Eduardo objects against Parker’s decisions, which made him lose a big part of his shares. After confronting the two leaders, Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg before being removed from the masthead as the co-founder. Eventually, Mark has a change of heart and cuts ties with Sean, realising his mistakes.
            </p>

            <h3>Themes and characters</h3>
            <p>The film approaches themes like friendship, loyalty, power and greed. The first two of them are constantly shown through the degrading relationship between Mark and Eduardo, former friends who, eventually, end up in a trial. If the search for power is what drives Mark to start Facebook in an attempt to grow in popularity, his greed is the one that pushes him forward in this process. Several unethical decisions are made, as he continuously uses the people around him for the “greater good” of himself and Facebook, ending up alone by sacrificing all of his relationships. Had he realised his mistakes earlier, he might have been able to save some of them. Ironically, the finale shows us he has one million friends on Facebook, while being isolated from people in real life.
            </p>

            <h3>My recommandations</h3>
            <p>To sum up, “The Social Network” is one of the most relevant films up to this date, especially in the current political and social climate. On top of that, anyone can enjoy it, from casual moviegoers to cinephiles as it presents the dawns of social media.
