# CinemaStory
The site of a cinema - developed as a project during the first year of college.

The project is hosted using Github Pages and can be accessed [here](https://vladc15.github.io/CinemaStory/).

It features multiple complex aspects of web development, through the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Canvas.
The site is responsive and interactive, allowing the user to book seats to a selected film.

At the same time, it presents a drop-down menu, an organized layout (utilizing both Flex and Grid) and complex transitions and animations as a part of CSS. 
In terms of JavaScript, the site makes use of RegEx in validating input, localStorage for keeping track of the seats, a news page in both English and Romanian languages and a real-time clock drawn with Canvas .
